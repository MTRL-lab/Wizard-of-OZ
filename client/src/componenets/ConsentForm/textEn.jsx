            We are asking you to participate in a participatory architectural design project in ZHR Galilee  Industrial Park, Israel. This study is being led by Aaron Sprecher and Jonathan Dortheimer in the Faculty of Architecture at Technion - Israel Institute of Technology and Qian Yang and Stephen Yang in the Department of Information Science at Cornell University.

        <Typography variant="h6">What the study is about</Typography>

        <Typography variant="body1">
            This research project seeks to investigate the various approaches to stakeholder participation in architectural design. Using a community-building project in the ZHR Galilee Industrial Park as a case study, we seek to deploy a novel crowdsourcing system that can (1) aggregate stakeholders&apos; preferences through design selection and (2) converse with stakeholders through a chatbot. We seek to explore how the crowdsourcing system can be used in conjunction with traditional methods of stakeholder participation (e.g., open discussion meetings, co-design workshops) in the context of designing the built environment.

        <Typography variant="body1">
            You are free to choose not to participate in the study and/or to terminate my participation in it at any time.  <u>You can participate as little and as much as you wish - none of the activities listed below are mandatory</u>.
            If you agree to participate, we will ask you to do the following:

        <ol>
            <li>
                <Typography variant="body1">
                    Sign-up: Participants will sign up to participate in our study through a web-based sign-up form. We will collect participants&apos; phone number, email address, and their affiliations with the neighboring localities.

                    Attend in-person open meetings to voice your aspirations, needs, and values. The meetings will be audio recorded; the discussion notes will be aggregated into design requirements and shared with all stakeholders anonymously. You will not be asked to do anything additional than what the workshops involve.

                <Typography variant="body1">
                    Attend in-person co-design workshops to concretize your design ideas in the form of sketches. The workshops will be audio-recorded; the discussion notes and the sketches produced will be shared with all stakeholders anonymously. You will not be asked to do anything additional than what the workshops involve.

                    Converse with our AI  chatbot:  You will have conversations with our chatbot to provide a deeper understanding of your preferences and ideas. We will ask you to share what you like and don’t like about a specific design by typing down your thoughts through the “chat” function. The text of the conversations will be recorded; the conversations will be aggregated into design requirements that will be shared with the architects anonymously.

                    Vote among design sketches: Through our system, you will be asked to vote among design sketches. The aggregated and anonymous voting results will be shared with all stakeholders.

                    Surveys: After each conversation with the chatbot, we will ask you to fill out a survey to reflect on your experience. We will use Qualtrics for the surveys.

                <Typography variant="body1">
                    Interviews and Focus Groups: At the end of the project, we will conduct interviews and focus groups with the participants to underpin your experience participating in the design process. These may take place either virtually on Zoom or in person. If you speak about the content of the focus group outside the group, it is expected that you will not tell others what individual participants said.

        <Typography variant="body1">

            We do not anticipate any risks from participating in this research. While participants will not receive compensation for participating in the study, you can make an impact on the design of a community center in their own neighborhood.

            Audio/Video Recording
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1">
            In order to better capture your needs, aspirations, values, and opinions, we will keep a record of all the textual documents and sketches you created, and we will audio record all sessions of engagement (town hall meeting, co-design workshop, interview, focus group). For the town open discussion meetings, co-design workshops, interviews, and focus groups, if you consent to be part of the research process, you are consenting to the session being recorded.
