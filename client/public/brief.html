<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>A core of this initiative and the central idea in the building philosophy is the ZHR ICE Center. The Center’s reason d’etre is to serve local learning and teaching communities by providing pedagogical and curricular resources, as well as providing space to host and manage gatherings of learning community members of all ages, from 1-99+. The Center aspires to enable community members ample opportunities to engage, experiment, and evolve – individually and collectively for the benefit of society. </p>

<h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
<p>The ZHR Building will be a versatile, state-of-the-art facility that meets the needs of its users today and into the future by providing flexibility. It will feature private offices and production spaces of various sizes, as well as collaborative workspaces with private video conference cabins. </p>
<p>The building will have rooms for instruction and presentation, like meetings, workshops, and courses. As well as space for creative production, like makers spaces, artist workshops, as well as places for collaborative work on projects, and common space(s) that allows people to meet and communicate. In addition, the building could have an auditorium (concert and/or conference hall), conference breakout rooms, a changing art display space, and spaces for sports or physical fitness. The building will also have an outdoor plaza/yard, a cafeteria/kitchen/coffee corner and dining room with seating areas, and formal and informal meeting places.</p>
<h2>Aesthetic Aspirations</h2>
<p>The aesthetic vision for the project is to create a building that would have a harmonious relationship with nature (nature entering the building), be respectful of its surroundings, and allow nature to be visible from the inside. The building should be designed to be iconic, with a clear and memorable shape. The goal is to create a space that is highly accessible and inviting, with plenty of light and open space. The elevations of the building should be designed to be innovative and inviting and to show the uses of the building by being transparent.</p>
<p>The building should be designed in a way that takes advantage of the stunning views of the mountains and the surrounding nature. The building has two fronts, one facing the street (south) and the other facing the inter-city road (north).</p>
<h2>Sustainability and Accessibility Aspirations</h2>
<p>The building should be designed to be as sustainable and eco-friendly as possible. It should be made of materials that can be reused or recycled, and that require minimal energy to produce. It should be designed and built in a way that minimizes operational energy requirements, for example positioning the structure in a way that leverages the natural sun and wind directions to reduce energy needs. </p> 
<p>All spaces in the building should be accessible, comfortable, welcoming for all ages and abilities, and adaptable enough to be used for a variety of purposes.</p>
<h2>Social Impact</h2>
<p>The building, in its entirety, acts as a physical platform for cultural and educational innovation benefiting both ICE and other tenants. The building serves as a hub for the community, offering a variety of activities and places to gather, both during the day and in the evening. It should showcase the community's art and culture, both inside and out, and provide a space for youth to meet. </p>
<p>The building will serve as a fulcrum for local communities to come together, leverage talents and creativity, learn new skills and experiment with abilities, develop one’s potential, build long-term relationships, and improve the learning experience and outcomes. </p>
